**Karl Niebuhr** is an avid reader, and curious character. He is also eclectic.

>Eclectic: a person who derives ideas, style, or taste from a broad and diverse range of sources.

That's because Karl doesn't like to limit himself to one topic like the area of his study. Speaking of study, he is a Computer Science Master's student. With a passionate interested in the fields of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Cryptography, Security and distributed technologies.

Whenever he is not reachable in any of the social networks he is likely abducted, just devouring information or forging malicious plans about worl.. Universe domination. Because as he uses to say, it is hard to guarantee a general entropy minimization so he'd better take control of things.  

*He loves to communicate with people so feel free to reach out to him!*
