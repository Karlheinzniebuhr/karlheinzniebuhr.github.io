Today I prepared whole wheat noodles, one of my favorites not only because they are tasty, but because they are a healthy source of carbs of course, but also protein. More interestingly, they contain a good amount of leucine, the supposedly most anabolic amino acid for those gains baby.

### How to prepare

- Cook the noodles for 5-10 minutes, then rinse
- Meanwhile, cut 3 cloves of garlic, half an onion, and 3 tomatoes manually or if you want to get it done super fast, throw everything in the food processor.
- Cut one eggplant into pieces manually
- Saute the tomato mixture in a saute pan together with the pieces of eggplant for 10 minutes

Mix the noodles with the sauce and you are ready to go, add salt and other condiments to taste. I also added some rice, lentils, and broccoli. Bon Appetit 🌱
