Why is this so powerful? That's what I asked me when I first head Gary talk about intent. Then I realised, our actions are flawed, we make mistakes, lots of them. So if we screw up we feel bad. But we don't have to if our intent was good from the get. We just have to set our intent right and say sorry if we screw up. It is really as easy as it sounds.

> Intent is not being talked about enough. Listen, actions are greater than words. But before you get into actions they oftentimes, not always are mapping to your intent. And I just think it's people's North Star it's their religion it's their thing. I'm always comfortable in my skin because I know what my intent is and if I mess up then I'll say I'm sorry but it's really exciting to know that it didn't start or come from a bad place. It puts me at peace and it puts me at peace as a professional it puts me at peace as a human being.
