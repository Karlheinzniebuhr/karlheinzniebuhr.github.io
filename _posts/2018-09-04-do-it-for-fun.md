In [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ-ncN8c6Yk) Eli the Computer Guy talks about something I’d love more
people to understand. He explains that most people expect to get
money out of their first business idea. But most people don’t see
beyond that initial decision. We have to consider things like:

- Will people be interested in my solution/service or whatever I offer?

- If I
can execute my idea successfully, will I like doing it all the time,
for a prolonged time? In other words, will I still love doing it next
year?

Wouldn’t it be much better to start something you love to do as a hobby, and then once you have an audience or a working product, go out and seek how to finance your project? A venture capitalist would for sure pay more attention to you if you tell her that you already have a lot of people using your product, or working with you as a functioning team, etc.

If you
start doing it for the money right from the start you run into a lot
of other issues too. For instance, people will come in with
expectations which you don’t know yet if you’ll satisfy. And you
will l have to worry about lots of bureaucracy implied in a business.

If you
start out doing something as a hobby instead, once you do want to
convert in in a business, you already know how much you will have to
charge. How people are going to receive it, how much you expect to
make, how to set expectations and lots of other nuances.

So
instead of thinking wanting to make your idea your primary work only
to end up being discouraged when you fail, try going out there and
experiment. Start doing what you love, try different things, without
making a business out of it. Do it just for the fun. Then once you
get people interested in something you do, start thinking about how
you can make money out of it.

And as
Gary V. already said: **You can’t put in the hours unless you
love it.**
