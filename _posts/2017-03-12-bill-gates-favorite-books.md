Bill Gates has a section dedicated to book reviews on [his blog](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books#All). Here are some of his favorites.

- ['The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined' by Steven Pinker](https://www.amazon.com/Better-Angels-Our-Nature-Violence-ebook/dp/B0052REUW0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1512071783&sr=8-1&keywords=%27The+Better+Angels+of+Our+Nature%3A+Why+Violence+Has+Declined%27+by+Steven+Pinker&tag=kasbl023-20)

"Although a lot of people have never heard of Borlaug, he probably saved more lives than anyone else in history," [Gates says](http://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Man-Who-Fed-the-World). "It's estimated that his new seed varieties saved a billion people from starvation,"

- ['The Man Who Fed the World' by Leon Hesser](https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Fed-World/dp/1935764136/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1512143416&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Man+Who+Fed+the+World+leon&tag=kasbl023-20)

- ['Business Adventures: Twelve Classic Tales from the World of Wall Street' by John Brooks](https://www.amazon.com/Business-Adventures-Twelve-Classic-Street-ebook/dp/B00L1TPCKW/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1512143662&sr=1-1&keywords=%27Business+Adventures%3A+Twelve+Classic+Tales+from+the+World+of+Wall+Street%27+by+John+Brooks&tag=kasbl023-20)

"The Best Business Book I’ve Ever Read"
"Not long after I first met Warren Buffett back in 1991, I asked him to recommend his favorite book about business. He didn’t miss a beat: “It’s *Business Adventures*, by John Brooks,” he said. “I’ll send you my copy.” I was intrigued: I had never heard of *Business Adventures* or John Brooks.
Today, more than two decades after Warren lent it to me—and more than four decades after it was first published—*Business Adventures* remains the best business book I’ve ever read. John Brooks is still my favorite business writer. (And Warren, if you’re reading this, I still have your copy.)" - [Bill](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Business-Adventures)

- ['How to Lie with Statistics' by Darrell Huff](https://www.amazon.com/How-Lie-Statistics-Darrell-Huff-ebook/dp/B00351DSX2/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1512143917&sr=1-1&keywords=%27How+to+Lie+with+Statistics%27+by+Darrell+Huff&tag=kasbl023-20)

"more relevant than ever," ... "One chapter shows you how visuals can be used to exaggerate trends and give distorted comparisons," he says. "It's a timely reminder, given how often infographics show up in your Facebook and Twitter feeds these days." - [Bill](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/How-to-Lie-with-Statistics)

- ['The Myth of the Strong Leader' by Archie Brown](https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Strong-Leader-Political-Leadership-ebook/dp/B00GL9TP1Y/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1512145192&sr=1-1&keywords=%27The+Myth+of+the+Strong+Leader%27+by+Archie+Brown&tag=kasbl023-20)

"Brown takes a deep look at the traits and tendencies leaders exhibit, and the categories they fall into, as a way of understanding the egos, motivations, and behaviors responsible for so much progress, and so much suffering, in the world. Throughout, he presents a new way to think about today’s challenges—and the people we entrust with solving them. " - [Bill](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Myth-of-the-Strong-Leader)

- ['Making the Modern World: Materials and Dematerialization' by Vaclav Smil](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Modern-World-Materials-Dematerialization-ebook/dp/B00FNWQJOQ/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1512145864&sr=1-2&keywords=Making+the+Modern+World%2C&tag=kasbl023-20)

"It might seem mundane, but the issue of materials — how much we use and how much we need — is key to helping the world’s poorest people improve their lives," - [Bill](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Making-the-Modern-World)

- ['The Grid: The Fraying Wires Between Americans and Our Energy Future' by Gretchen Bakke](https://www.amazon.com/Grid-Fraying-Between-Americans-Energy-ebook/dp/B01DM9Q6CQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1512146603&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Grid%3A+The+Fraying+Wires&tag=kasbl023-20)

"Honorable mention: *The Grid*, by Gretchen Bakke. This book, about our aging electrical grid, fits in one of my favorite genres: “Books About Mundane Stuff That Are Actually Fascinating.” Part of the reason I find this topic fascinating is because my first job, in high school, was writing software for the entity that controls the power grid in the Northwest. But even if you have never given a moment’s thought to how electricity reaches your outlets, I think this book would convince you that the electrical grid is one of the greatest engineering wonders of the modern world. I think you would also come to see why modernizing the grid is so complex and so critical for building our clean-energy future. " - [Bill](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Best-Books-2016)

- ['The Gene: An Intimate History' by Siddhartha Mukherjee](https://www.amazon.com/Gene-Intimate-History-Siddhartha-Mukherjee-ebook/dp/B017I25DCC/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1512146736&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Gene%3A+An+Intimate+History&tag=kasbl023-20)

"In *The Gene*, Mukherjee once again shows his gift for making hard science easily accessible. He wrote this book for general audiences, because he knows that it’s not good enough for scientists alone to debate the huge ethical questions that their discoveries provoke. As he emphasized repeatedly in our conversation, determining the proper rules and boundaries for these technologies requires broad public discussion, debate, and consensus." - [Bill](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Gene)

- [The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History](https://www.amazon.com/Sixth-Extinction-Unnatural-History-ebook/dp/B00EGJE4G2/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1512147346&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Sixth+Extinction&tag=kasbl023-20)

"Climate change is a big problem—one of the biggest we’ll face this century—but it’s not the only environmental concern on the horizon. Humans are putting down massive amounts of pavement, moving species around the planet, over-fishing and acidifying the oceans, changing the chemical composition of rivers, and more. Natural scientists posit that there have been five extinction events in the Earth’s history (think of the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs), and Kolbert makes a compelling case that human activity is leading to the sixth. Unlike a lot of people who write about the environment, Kolbert doesn’t resort to hype. She just lays out the facts and wraps them in memorable anecdotes. It’s a sobering but engaging and informative read." - [Bill](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Sixth-Extinction)
