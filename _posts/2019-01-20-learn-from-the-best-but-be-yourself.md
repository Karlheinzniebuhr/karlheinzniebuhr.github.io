I’m a big fan of
Gary V., particularly his message. But don’t like how some people
try to copy him and other succesful peole 1:1. You might get better
at some things copying people, but it isn’t really the best thing
you can do. The best asset you have is being yourself. I learned this
from experience and because other succesful people repeatedly preach
it.

It is almost common knowledge by now but I still am surprised at how easy it is to try to be fake just to impress people or being accepted. But it is foolish. Most perceive if we aren’t authentic and they don’t like it. I feel like being more myself is another key element of the long list of benefits I get from meditation.

You also got to **Understand the difference between who you are vs who you wish you were.** You can’t really start building yourself If you constantly bullshit yourself. Self-awareness is key in the success game. Start doing a little introspection, maybe even mindfulness meditation.

Learn
to do you, and watch the world come to you.

I
hugely recommend [this
video from Gary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXsFPZp3fQ) for some lessons that will bring you on the path
to progress.
