> investors – large and small – should instead read Jack Bogle’s The Little Book of Common Sense Investing"I insist on a lot of time being spent, almost every day, to just sit and think. That is very uncommon in American business. I read and think. So I do more reading and thinking, and make less impulse decisions than most people in business. I do it because I like this kind of life." - Warren Buffet

"To invest successfully over a lifetime does not require a stratospheric IQ, unusual business insights, or inside information.

You must provide the emotional discipline." - WB

Gates says he asked Warren Buffett back in 1991 what his favorite business book was, and Buffett responded by sending his personal copy of "Business Adventures."
Gates fell in love with the storytelling. He writes:
Brooks's work is a great reminder that the rules for running a strong business and creating value haven't changed. For one thing, there's an essential human factor in every business endeavor. It doesn't matter if you have a perfect product, production plan and marketing pitch; you'll still need the right people to lead and implement those plans. - [Source](http://www.businessinsider.com/lessons-in-bill-gates-favorite-book-business-adventures-2014-7)

'Howard Marks, chairman and co-founder of Oak Tree Capital, intended to wait until he retired to write this book, as noted in a [2011 *Barron's* review](http://www.barrons.com/articles/SB50001424052748704900704576594941136960356). But Buffett so admired Marks's client memos that he offered to write a dust-jacket blurb if Marks would publish the book sooner.

The result is "a rarity, a useful book," Buffett reportedly said.

Marks aims to help investors achieve success by putting more thought into their decisions. He draws heavily on his own mistakes and what he learned from them.' - [Source](https://www.inc.com/business-insider/18-books-that-influenced-warren-buffet.html)
