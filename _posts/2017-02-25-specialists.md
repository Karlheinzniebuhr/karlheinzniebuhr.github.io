Some thoughts on this quote mentioned by Jonathan Rosenberg.

> Don't hire specialists, especially in high tech. Change is the only thing permanent. “I have no special talent just passionate curiosity.” ~ Einstein.

I find this statement so funny because it is like a bitch-slap to modern education.
Of course the way the world works right now depends on specialists! If you want to go work for the industry, most likely you will have to specialize ([at least for now](https://www.karlbooklover.com/whole-new-mind-summary/)). But if you want to become an entrepreneur, the contrary might be true.
In fact, a [study](http://www.adlit.org/article/5665/) found that 40% of millionaires are dyslexic. Remember that the next time you plan to specialize in something. And if you do specialize, you should carefully evaluate the ROI of your time, money and energy.
And if you do decide to specialize, you should carefully evaluate the ROI of your time, money and energy. And evaluate your intrinsic motivation, i.e., is it really what you want to do?
