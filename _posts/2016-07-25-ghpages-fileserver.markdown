Today's afternoon Experiment consisted of a simple file server which runs on top of gh-pages.¬†

Github is an awesome way to have virtually free hosting. The problem I noticed is that there was no easy way to "serve" files once¬†you have them uploaded.
Inserting every Link manually in Markdown is a very time-consuming and boring task. There has to be an easier way. Luckily Jekyll supports static files [http://jekyllrb.com/docs/static-files/.](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/static-files/)

All I did was just loop over all files and filter out the ones contained in the /resources directory. Otherwise, irrelevant files of the blog would be displayed on the screen.

This simple thing + some formatting and voila, we got a nice little file server running.
