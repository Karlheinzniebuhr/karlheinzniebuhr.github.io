I'm one of those happy guys who participated in the legendary 2011 Stanford MOOC, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. That course made me (and thousands of students around the world) discover a whole different and revolutionary method of learning.
I think today there is no question that Online Education works, but sometimes the question still comes up, is it enough to just learn online? I think it depends heavily on the subject, CS happens to be particularly well suited for self and online education.
I did a little throwback today by watching this talk from Sebastian Thrun where he mentions how online students from the AI course compared to actual Stanford students.

- 75.5% college students preferred the speed of learning of the Udacity class rather than the traditional class.
- 411 of the best online students were better than all Stanford students of the same class.

Udacity nowadays is at a whole new level of teaching. I particularly like the nano degrees. They really go into a lot of depth and make you job ready. Right now I'm taking the [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd101/). I've observed Udacity and taken several courses over the years and it is doing better and better. Thanks, Sebastian!
