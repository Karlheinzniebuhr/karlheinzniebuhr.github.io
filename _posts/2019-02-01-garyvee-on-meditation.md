With the level of self-awareness, confidence, kindness, and practicality of Gary Vaynerchuk exudes, and his great ability to teach, have made me a big fan of him. I absorb his content like a sponge. But how did he become that way? He says that he got lucky and has good DNA. Besides that, he put in a lot of work, work on himself, that’s how I believe he got to that point.

I’d usually recommend people to meditate if they want to achieve Gary’s qualities. Certainly, I felt getting more of those, and many other qualities over the years from meditation. But he doesn’t actually meditate. In [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0aBRVgbsJs) he talks briefly about the topic, I’m paraphrasing.

“I don’t meditate, but I kind of live a very thoughtful mindful spiritual macro intriguing mindset life. I often say that I live in a cocoon. I go to myself, I’m self-soothing… you know it’s funny when you asked that question, I literally thought about a cat licking itself… I’d tell you that I do a mental version of that. When I have a second for myself where I’m not working, I go to myself.”
