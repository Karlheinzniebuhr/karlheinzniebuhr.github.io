These are some of the basics about reading I got from Tai Lopez's material.

#### The Basics

- Have one or several reading rituals every day.
- Be in a comfortable position.
- Make sure to turn off distractions.
- Use a highlighter.

#### Before starting to read

- Set a goal before starting to read. “Why am I reading this book?”
- Start by the table of contents.
- Read what people say about the author to unlock you authority bias.

#### Remember

- Do not forget to re-read the best books. Only by repetition will you make the knowledge instinctual.
- Read books about a variety of important topics which will help you get a better life quality such as health, wealth, love/social and happiness.
- Don’t get scared from Fear of missing out (FOMO). You should be able just to grab a book and read the relevant stuff for you at this moment, then put it aside without feeling bad. You can get back to it later.

#### Subtypes of books, just to have an idea:

- Classics (at least 50 years old and highly respected, big picture)
- How to books (practical)
- Biographies (learn my osmosis, courage, motivation)

### Practical stuff about reading

#### Read different books differently

- The fastest to read are the how-to books.
- With classic books, you will probably go slower.
- Read biographies slow enough so that you can savor them.

#### How to read

A quick review in the **table of contents**, first chapter, and last chapter to get a brief overview.
**Identify** and **isolate** **key** **chapters** depending on your **time** and of the **type of book**.
Don't be afraid to read out of order sometimes, it can spark your curiosity and help you isolate key chapters when you have little time.
