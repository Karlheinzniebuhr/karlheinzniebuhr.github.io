> Man is the sum of his thoughts.

Do you know someone who always seems to have bad luck in life? Now tell me, has that person an inherent optimistic and positive attitude, always striving for more, never giving up?
Or does he/she lean towards a more negative view about life, frequently saying things like “Sh\*\* happens, this is just how life is, I’ll never be lucky, I cannot compete with those people, there is nothing I can do about this” etc.
The odds are that that person leans heavily towards the negative attitude. Why? Because attitude and action go hand in hand. Underachievers tend not to act at all or disappoint themselves because they think they won’t succeed anyway.
So what’s the solution? Simple, if thoughts are closely related with character and actions, then changing our thoughts will solve the root of the problem. Mastering your attitude can literally bring peace, joy, strength and wisdom to your life.

#### Are we victims of our circumstances?

We all know someone who has a heart of gold and still faces adversity. This means that deducing someone’s attitude and character from her circumstances is impossible. Likewise, it is hard to predict the circumstances for someone solely based on their character.
The thing is, whether we are victims of our circumstances or not, it is not useful to think of ourselves as victims. It is not empowering. It is wasteful. No matter the situation we face, we should stay true to our values and ideals.
Our dreams and aspirations are what give us the impetus to turn our goals into achievements. That’s why it is crucial to keep your dreams alive. Let go of all negative and distracting thoughts and focus on the thoughts which get you closer to your goal.
Dream purposefully about the outcome you desire and discipline your mind to focus on what you want. It isn't easy, especially when you are just starting to direct your thoughts, but your mind is like a muscle, with practice you will become better at it.
Hope you’ll learn to empower your thoughts.
