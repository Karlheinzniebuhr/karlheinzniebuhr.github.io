> “In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter area) who didn't read all the time—none. Zero. You'd be amazed at how much Warren reads—and how much I read. My children laugh at me. They think I'm a book with a couple of legs sticking out.” - Charlie

*“This program will help executives make better decisions and use their influence wisely… Robert Cialdini has had a greater impact on my thinking on this topic than any other scientist… The best popular book that**demonstrates six or eight ways in which the quirks of your own mind will frequently prove dysfunctional to your best interests is Cialdini’s Influence.”*

"*I must confess that I am a hopeless lover of biographies and autobiographies. With that caveat in* mind *I found this book on the life of Mr. Rockefeller intriguing.

Read the book “F.I.A.S.C.O.”, by law professor and former derivatives trader **Frank Partnoy**, an insider account of depravity in derivative trading at one of the biggest and best regarded Wall Street firms. The book will turn your stomach. - [“Academic Economics: Strengths and Faults After Considering Interdisciplinary Needs" By Charles T.

*"The argument this book advocates is simple: population must stop growing if human society wants to keep increasing its standard of living. Mr. Hardin believes population levels have reached catastrophic proportions and must be curtailed immediately. He proposes many unique solutions though I think the main stream public will find the majority of them to be acceptable solutions."*

## [The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language](https://www.amazon.com/Language-Instinct-Mind-Creates-P-S/dp/0061336467/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1516187582&sr=1-1-spell&keywords=The+Language+Instinct%3A+How+the+Mind+Creates+Languag&tag=kasbl023-20)

*I've read all the books on the Great Recession. They're all good. I find the story of John Paulson to be particularly fascinating. He made a lot of money from entirely legal ways but may have created a lot of trouble for himself in the process. Now every nice young man wants to be him, and since he did it with derivatives, it's that much worse. His influence has been pernicious in an unintentional way.* - Charlie in 2010 Wesco meeting

*"I loved Caro s book I thought it was very well done. I think reading his biography on LBJ is very important for anyone who wants a view* into *the human condition. LBJ never told the truth when a lie would be better. This is the way he went through life. He had a high intellect and extraordinary energy and did a lot of good along with the bad. I m not sure he didn't do more good than bad. But I think it's an appalling life to lie as much as LBJ. What I said at Berkshire meeting about the robber barons applies here: When he s talking, he s lying, and when he's quiet, he's stealing."* - Charlie Munger, 2004 Wesco Annual Meeting.

## [The Little Book of Common Sense Investing](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Common-Sense-Investing-ebook/dp/B075Z6HSCJ/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1516189291&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Little+Book+of+Common+Sense+Investing&tag=kasbl023-20)

## [Benjamin Franklin: An American Life](https://www.amazon.com/Benjamin-Franklin-American-Walter-Isaacson-ebook/dp/B000FBJG4U/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1516189553&sr=1-1&keywords=Benjamin+Franklin%3A+An+American+Life&tag=kasbl023-20)

## [Deep Simplicity: Bringing Order to Chaos and Complexity](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Simplicity-Bringing-Order-Complexity/dp/140006256X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1516189629&sr=1-1&keywords=Deep+Simplicity%3A+Bringing+Order+to+Chaos+and+Complexity&tag=kasbl023-20)

*"A Matter of Degrees, by* physicist *named Segre, is a perfectly marvelous book. Not a book you can go through at 90 mph, but if you parse through it slowly, you'll get a lot out of it. You'll get a lot of hours per dollar if you use it right."* - Charlie Munger, 2003 Wesco Annual Meeting.

## [Darwin's Blind Spot: Evolution Beyond Natural Selection](https://www.amazon.com/Darwins-Blind-Spot-Evolution-Selection/dp/0618118128/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1516189775&sr=1-1&keywords=Darwin%27s+Blind+Spot%3A+Evolution+Beyond+Natural+Selection&tag=kasbl023-20)

*"I also recommend How the Scots Invented the Modern World: The True Story of How Western Europe's Poorest Nation Created Our World and Everything in It.
