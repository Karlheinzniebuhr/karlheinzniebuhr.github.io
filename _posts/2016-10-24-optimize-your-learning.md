**"Knowledge is only potential power; it becomes power when we act on it."**

I made a short summary of [Jim Kwik's](https://kwiklearning.com/about/) best tips about boosting brainpower and optimize learning.

The most important points can be remembered easily by the acronym FAST. Fast stands for:

**F Forget  
A Active  
S State  
T Teach**  
<!--more-->

Now let’s go into the details about every state.

- Be present!  (**Forget** everything else and just focus on learning) For more details check out:  7 (plus or minus two) short term memory http://www.simplypsychology.org/short-term-memory.html
- Be an **active** learner, ask questions!  (how am I going to use this, apply this, teach this to others) Put comments etc.
- Don’t outsource your brain (digital dementia), train it!
- Take notes! It boosts retention by 50%
- Do whole brain note-taking. (Use the left and right side of the brain) left = logic, right = creative. left side -> note taking, right side -> note making.
    - divide your paper with a line, on the left side make notes, on the right side write down your impressions of the notes, visuals (how you are going to use it, etc.)
- Al learning is **state** dependent.
    - Always do a check of the state of your mind and body before learning something, because the emotion you attach to information becomes a long term memory.
    - Learn in a curious, fascinating, exciting state!
    - You can change your state in two ways, either by changing your mind (by asking questions) or changing your body (physical exercises).
- **Teach**! Teaching helps to solidify knowledge and understanding further.


That's all, remember to apply these principles, because knowledge is only potential power, it becomes power when we act on it.
