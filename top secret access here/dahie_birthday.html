Now you are a big girl :D, nah.. you were big before, it's just a new legal annotation this time. Anyways I hope this new year brings you closer to\ your<br> dreams, and  if you still don't exactly know what your dream is don't worry, you will figure it out by time. <br>It took me a long time\ too to check out what\ is it that I found most interesting to study and do :) <br> And there is still so much I didn't figure out but the journey\ in figuring out I think is equally important. \
I want you to know that whenever you need something, maybe about computer science or whatever don't hesitate to ask. It's a big pleasure to talk\ with you about any of the things we use to talk about, whether it is studying in Europe or some new discovery in science.<br> \
Take care of yourself and stay awesome, I like you a lot.<br> \
Have a great day today :) <br>\
Karl\
